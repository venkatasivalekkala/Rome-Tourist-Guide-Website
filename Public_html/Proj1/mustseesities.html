			<p><span>The Colosseum:</span> The site of many bloody gladiatorial fights, the Colosseum, which was finished in 80 A.D.,
			could then hold about 50,000 spectators. With a circumference of 573 yards and sitting on marshland, experts say the Colosseum 
			is an engineering wonder…not to mention an animal and human rights atrocity.<br/>Recent Colosseum visitors recommend getting 
			a tour guide, with some saying it gives more context, providing a richer experience than simply viewing the structure. Other
			travelers specifically suggest taking a night tour to beat the crowds.The Colosseum is open daily, from morning until 
			about an hour before sunset, and you can find it off the Colosseo metro stop.The site of many bloody gladiatorial fights,

			<p><span>Trastevere:</span> <span>R</span>ome’s picture-perfect ‘left bank’ can still sock an edgy cultural punch. Hip, 
			contemporary galleries stud its cobbled streets and it’s here you’ll find the ever-diminishing trasteverini,
			the real-deal locals who consider themselves Rome’s true classical descendants. It’s no wonder sensitive souls 
			still feel at home. Trastevere is a visual charmer, crammed with ivy-tickled ochre façadesk, labyrinthine laneways,
			vintage trattorias and buzzing, chilled-out squares. Indeed, the area is a hit with foreigners, who flock here to live
			out their Roman fantasy. There’s even an American university on Via della Lungara for those needing a heftier reason to linger.</p>

			<p><span>The Vatican:</span> Historically beautiful, rich and powerful, it was in the Ager Vaticanus stadium just south 
			of the Vatican that 1st-century emperor Nero martyred the Christian faithful. Among them was apostle Peter, whose tomb lies 
			beneath the monumental St Peter’s Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro). Downstairs in the Vatican grottoes are the papal tombs,
			among them the simple marble slab that Pope John Paul II now calls home. Far less modest are the adjacent Vatican Museums, an
			exhausting feast of art, and home to the world’s most famous frescoes in the legendary Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo’s astounding
			ceiling and wall frescoes that take the cake – picture terrified sinners and ravishing prophets bursting out in 3-D brilliance. </p>

			<p><span>Palatine Hill:</span> With its tranquil vibe and unforgettable views, the Palatine’s appeal is clear. A snoop around Museo
			Palatino is a good place to start your hillside exploration. From here, ramble through the ruins, which boast highlights such as
			Emperor Domitian’s epic Domus Flavia (Imperial Palace); the stucco-laced Casa dei Grifi ; the 16th-century Orti Faranesi gardens;
			and the Casa di Livia, whose sumptuous frescoes now wow in Museo Nazionale Romano: Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. </p>

			<p><span>Roman panoramas:</span>Originally perched on seven hills, and now sprawling over several more, Rome seems specially made 
			for jaw-dropping vistas. Other cities might boast taller peaks – both natural and artificial – but few can match the Eternal City’s
			near-flawless historical sweeps.Originally perched on seven hills, and now sprawling over several more, Rome seems specially made

			<p><span>Visit Another Church in Rome:</span> Most people I know make plans to see St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican during a
			visit to Rome, but many people overlook all the other fantastic churches in this church-heavy city. (And I know that technically 
			the Pantheon is still a church, but I don’t count it as such for these purposes.) Rather than just suggest one of them, however,
			I’m suggesting that you find at least one other church that sounds or looks interesting to you and make it a point to visit it. 
			Many of the churches in Rome house works of art by masters, artists whose names you know, and there’s often no fee to get in, so
			it’s a bargain traveler’s dream, too. Santa Maria del Popolo has two Caravaggio paintings, Santa Maria della Vittoria has Bernini’s
			“St. Teresa in Ecstasy,” San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane was designed by Borromini, San Pietro in Vincoli has a Michelangelo statue 
			of Moses, Santa Maria in Trastevere is one of the city’s oldest churches, San Luigi dei Francesi has three Caravaggios, Santa Maria
			alla Minerva is the only Gothic church in Rome… The list goes on and on. At the very least, poke your head inside any church you 
			see that looks even vaguely interesting – you might end up finding what is, to you, a hidden Roman treasure. And that’s one of the
			best things that can happen when you travel.</p>

			<p><span>Pantheon:</span> "A magical space, expansive, evocative, and peaceful."—Ann Wise, Rome-based journalist. Rome's most 
			intact ancient monument; a massive sphere designed as a pagan temple by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 125; remained the world's largest
			concrete dome until the 1990s; houses the tombs of painter Raphael and 19th-century Italian king Vittorio Emanuele II. Go when
			it's raining to watch the drops shower through the oculus, the hole in the dome's top. Piazza della Rotonda</p>

			<p><span>Trevi Fountain:</span> Largest baroque fountain in Rome; terminal point of one of Rome's ancient aqueducts; designed in
			the 18th century by Nicola Salvi, with influences from Bernini; depicts the Roman God of the Sea, Neptune, being guided by Tritons; 
			coins in the fountain tossed by visitors heeding a maxim that throwing in a coin ensures a return to Rome; famously appears in the
			films Roman Holiday, La Dolce Vita, and more recent When in Rome.<br/> The Fontana di Trevi - or Trevi Fountain in English -is a
			fountain in Rome, Italy. It is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and the most beautiful in the world.A traditional legend 
			holds that if visitors throw a coin into the fountain, they are ensured a return to Rome.<br/>The fountain is worldwide famous but 
			many people do not know the history and the secrets hidden behind its construction. It is time to do justice to this extraordinary
			masterpiece of Italian art.</p>
