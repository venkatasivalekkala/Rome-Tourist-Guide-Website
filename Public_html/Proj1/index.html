			<p> <a href="history.html" > <span>History Of Rome :</span> </a> Rome is the capital city of Italy,
			the home of the Vatican and the Papacy, and was the centre of a vast, ancient empire.
			It remains a cultural and historical focus within Europe.<br/><br/>Legend says Rome was founded 
			by Romulus in 713 BCE, but probably predate this, from a time when the settlement
			was one of many on the Latium Plain. Rome developed where a salt trade route crossed the river 
			Tiber en route to the coast, near seven hills the city is said to be built on.It’s traditionally
			believed that the early rulers of Rome where kings, possibly Etruscans, who were driven out c. 500 BCE. </p>

			<p> <a href="neighborhoods.html" > <span>Neighborhoods of Rome :</span> </a>The descriptions of Rome neighborhoods are listed in order of location
			(most central first), and then followed by those areas just outside the historic center.These are my own impressions
			about them, based on several criteria you should consider when deciding where to stay in Rome, and how staying in any
			one of them could affect your stay here.</p>

			<p> <a href="arts.html" > <span>Art&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Architecture :</span></a>The Romans wanted their art and architecture to be useful. 
			They planned their cities and built bridges, aqueducts, public baths, and marketplaces, apartment houses, and harbors.
			When a Roman official ordered sculpture for a public square, he wanted it to tell future generations of the greatness of Rome.
			Although the practical uses of art were distinctly Roman, the art forms themselves were influenced by the ancient
			Greeks and Etruscans</p>
