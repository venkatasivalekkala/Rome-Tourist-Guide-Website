		<p> <span>R</span>ome originates as a village of the Latini in the 8th century BC. At first ruled by kings, the Roman Republic
		is established in 509 BC. During the 5th century BC, Rome gained regional dominance in Latium, and eventually the entire 
		Italian peninsula by the 3rd century BC. The population of the city at this point is estimated at about 300,000 people.
		</p>
		
		<p> With the Punic Wars, Rome gained dominance over the Mediterranean. Soon, Ancient Rome would displace Hellenistic Greece 
		as the dominant world power, with the city of Rome as its capital and most dominant city for the next five centuries. 
		After Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul, followed by a period of civil war, the Roman Empire was established under 
		Octavian in 27 BC. The city of Rome now surpassed a population of one million, likely the first city in history to 
		reach this size (compared to world population of about 200–300 million at the time).</p>
		
		<p> At the peak of Roman imperial power in the 2nd century, the population of the city numbered some 1.6 million, a size 
		it would never attain again until its becoming the capital of the Republic of Italy in 1946; close to 3% of the population 
		of the empire lived within its limits. Following the Crisis of the Third Century and the transfer of the imperial capital to 
		Constantinople in AD 330, Rome entered a period of gradual decline.
		</p>
		
		<p> After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Rome managed to hang on to the empire, still known as the Roman empire but 
		long centered on the eastern Mediterranean, until the 8th century as the Duchy of Rome. But the city was reduced to a fraction 
		of its former size, being sacked several times in the 5th to 6th centuries, in 546 even temporarily depopulated entirely.[1] With
		the final loss of imperial control in Italy, Rome became the capital of the Papal States in medieval Italy. Papacy struggled to 
		retain influence in the emerging Holy Roman Empire, and during the Saeculum obscurum, the population of Rome fell to as low as 
		30,000 inhabitants. Following the East–West Schism and the limited success in the Investiture Controversy, the Papacy did gain 
		considerable influence in high medieval Europe, but with the Avignon Papacy and the Western Schism, the city of Rome was reduced 
		to irrelevance, its population falling below 20,000.
		</p>

	 	<p>Rome's decline into complete irrelevance during the medieval period, with the associated lack of construction activity, assured 
		the survival of very significant ancient Roman material remains in the centre of the city, some abandoned and others continuing in 
		use. Rome began to recover some importance in the late 15th and 16th century, The Sistine Chapel was restored in 1480 and decorated
		by Michelangelo in 1508–1512. Construction of the Apostolic Palace began in 1589. Construction of St. Peter's Basilica, the most 
		renowned work of Renaissance architecture, was begun in 1506. The Roman Renaissance was cut short abruptly with the devastation of
		the city in 1527, but the Papacy reasserted itself in the Counter-Reformation, and the city continued to flourish during the early 
		modern period.
		</p>
		
		<p>Rome was annexed by Napoleon and was technically part of France during 1798–1814. During the Italian unification in the 19th 
		century, the Roman Question referred to the status of Rome under the temporal power of the popes. Rome was declared the capital 
		of the kingdom of Italy on 27 March 1861, but the Italian government could not take its seat there because it was defended by a 
		French garrison. Rome was eventually captured in 1870, and the dispute was finally resolved with the Lateran Pacts of 1929 
		establishing the Vatican State. Rome served as the capital of the Italian Empire and Fascist Italy from 1870 to 1943. During this
		period, population hextupled from about 250,000 to 1.5 million. The Palace of Justice was completed 1910.
		</p>
		
		<p> Under siege by the Allied invasion of Italy, Rome was bombed several times and eventually declared an open city on 14 August 1943. 
		As the capital of the Italian Republic (established in 1946), Rome at a population of 4.4 million in its metropolitan area (as of 2015;
		2.8 million within city limits) one of the largest cities in Italy (after Milan, and roughly on par with Naples), is among the largest
		urban areas of the European Union[2] and classified as a "global city".
		</p>
		
		<p> There is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from at least 5,000 years, but the dense layer of much 
		younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.[4] Evidence of stone tools, pottery and stone weapons attest to at least 
		6,000 years of human presence. The power of the well known tale of Rome's legendary foundation tends also to deflect attention from 
		its actual, and much more ancient, origins.The traditional date for the founding of Rome, following Marcus Terentius Varro,[5] is 
		21 April 753 BC, and the city and surrounding region of Latium has continued to be inhabited with little interruption since around 
		that time. Recent (2014) excavations have revealed a wall built long before the city's official founding year. Archaeologists 
		uncovered a stone wall, and pieces of pottery dating to the 9th century and the beginning of the 8th century, and there is evidence
		of people arriving on the Palatine hill as early as the 10th century BC.
